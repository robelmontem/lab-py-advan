    "En primer lugar, para la implementación original `reduc_operation`, así como para `numpy.sum` y la versión compilada con `@njit` sin paralelización, los tiempos de ejecución son independientes del número de hilos utilizados. Entre estas tres alternativas, `numpy.sum` presenta los **mejores resultados** en todos los casos. Esto se debe a que opera directamente sobre arrays de *nunpy* mediante rutinas internas altamente optimizadas en C, minimizando el overhead de Python. Aunque *numba* ofrece una aceleración significativa frente a la implementación original, su versión no paralelizada resulta **menos eficiente** que `numpy.sum` para este problema concreto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Al introducir paralelismo mediante *multiprocessing*, se observa una **sobrecarga** considerable cuando se utiliza un **único núcleo**, llegando incluso a empeorar el tiempo respecto a la implementación secuencial. Esta penalización se debe principalmente al coste de creación de procesos y a la copia de los datos entre procesos. No obstante, conforme aumenta el número de núcleos, el tiempo de ejecución disminuye de forma clara, aunque el escalado no es lineal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finalmente, la versión paralelizada con *numba* es la que ofrece los mejores resultados globales. Con dos núcleos ya supera al resto de métodos. Para el caso de $10^9$ elementos y 8 núcleos se obtiene una mejora de un factor de aproximadamente 764 respecto a la implementación original `reduc_operation`, confirmando que la paralelización a nivel de bucle mediante *numba* es la estrategia más eficiente para este tipo de reducción numérica."
