    "En primer lugar, para la versión sin optimización, tanto al usar `map` como la función `sum_primes`, los tiempos de ejecución son elevados y del mismo orden de magnitud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Al introducir *numba* en modo **secuencial** con `@njit`, se observa una mejora significativa en ambos enfoques. No obstante, el beneficio es mucho más notable en la función `sum_primes`, que pasa a ejecutarse en tiempos muy inferiores a los obtenidos mediante `map`. Esto se debe a que `sum_primes` presenta un bucle simple, ideal para ser optimizado por Numba.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cuando se emplea *multiprocessing* con `Pool`, la mejora se observa únicamente en el caso de `map`, ya que esta versión permite repartir el trabajo de forma natural entre procesos. La función `sum_primes` no se ha modificado, ya que sería igual que el bloque de `map`. A medida que aumenta el número de núcleos, el tiempo de ejecución disminuye, aunque el escalado no es lineal debido al coste de creación de procesos y a la comunicación entre ellos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finalmente, la versión paralelizada con *numba* aplicada a `sum_primes`, que ha ofrecido mejores resultados con $10^6$ elementos y algo inferiores a *multiprocessing* con $10^7$. Podemos concluir que, para **volumenes** más **grandes** de datos, sería conveniente usar **numba y multiprocessing** pudiendo llegar a obtener hasta una mejora en un factor de 150 frente al 117 de usar sólo *numba* con *@njit* y *prange*"
